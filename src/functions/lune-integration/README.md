# Lune Integration for CO2 Offset Order creation

This Foxy.io-Lune integration provides you with:

- a **custom shipping code** to add to the Custom Shipping Code feature on your Foxy Store Admin [Shipping Page](https://admin.foxycart.com/admin.php?ThisAction=ShippingSetup), for getting live shipping rates with CO2 offset estimates. The code is on the `custom-shipping-code.js` file under this folder.
- a **transaction webhook** to create an CO2 offset Order in Lune when a transaction is created.

## Usage

### Overview

- Sign up with Lune, and get an API key.
- Create Foxy OAuth Client Integration on the [Foxy Admin Integrations page](https://admin.foxycart.com/admin.php?ThisAction=AddIntegration), and save the credentials.
- Add the custom shipping code on your Foxy Store Admin [Shipping Page](https://admin.foxycart.com/admin.php?ThisAction=ShippingSetup), using the code on the `custom-shipping-code.js` file, filling in the data needed on the code from the OAuth client and Lune. There are other configuration variables that need data for the shipping code to work correctly, like the originAddress.
